# Volley-Example-in-Kotlin
An example on how to use Volley networking library to do CRUD operations, as well as load images using picasso

Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available on GitHub.

Volley offers the following benefits:

 - Automatic scheduling of network requests.
 - Multiple concurrent network connections.
 - Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.
 - Support for request prioritization.
 - Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.
 - Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff.
 - Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
 - Debugging and tracing tools.

iVolley interface handles a basic response from a test api

MyVolleyRequest contains all function API requests including the built in Image Loader

The MainActivity calls the functions
